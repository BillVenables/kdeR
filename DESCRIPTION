Title: Kernel Density Estimates
Version: 0.1.1

Description: A pure R implementation of one- and two-dimensional
    kernel density estimation with gaussian kernels.  The algorithm
    is naive and does not involve the FFT, and hence mainly for
    expository purposes, but is reasonably fast for intermediate
    sized samples.  known range limits are well handled.
